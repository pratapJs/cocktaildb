        Hello everyone. Welcome to my Site. My name is Pratap Adhikari. I am
        from Darwin, NT, Australia. I love to make cocktails. I first tried to
        make cocktail when i was 15 years old. This website is all about
        cocktails and the methods to make the cocktails. I have tried my best to
        make it simple and effective. Thanks to Saveena, Saroja and Sujata for
        helping me in this project. Hope you will like it. Please donot forget
        to provide me feedback @ pratapadhikari81@gmail.com. Thank you.
        Cheers!!!
